      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Eric Gikonyo. A hospitality professional. Currently pursuing software engineering as an add-on skill in my life. I have had the interest so much just thought I would explore.</p>

      <p>I chose Moringa hoping it would help in pursuing my interest but of late it feels like this is all on my own. In the very beginning on application I enquired and was advised that what I am applying for is beginner friendly but what I am going through seems like I am in a class of professionals and I am the idiot. Only did I come to discover that majority of the students had a previous session before May to introduce themselves into the course and that explained why our mentor is teaching a certain demographic of students. I cannot lie but thinking of giving up has struck through my mind every morning.</p>

      <p>Phase 0 I was not able to learn anything as a result we have assignment on top of other assignment. Lessons are not lessons they are just like a revision. And now Phase 1 has begun, and content for 2 days needs to be covered in one. How am I going to learn yet everything has a deadline? At this rate AI tools feel like the only way I am going to succeed.</p>
